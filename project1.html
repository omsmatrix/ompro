        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project investigates the dynamic interactions between plasma and liquid media, particularly focusing on their behavior within gas bubbles under electric fields. It aims to provide insights into plasma applications for environmental and agricultural systems, such as wastewater treatment and agriculture, where plasma-reactive species could enhance liquid phase reactions.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The dynamic interactions between plasma and liquid media are pivotal for environmental and agricultural engineering advancements. The behavior of plasma within gas bubbles in a liquid environment is particularly promising for wastewater treatment and agriculture due to its ability to transfer reactive species to the liquid phase. This study bridges the gap between experimental observations and computational predictions of electrohydrodynamics.</p>

        <p>Using enhanced PHASTA (Parallel Hierarchical Adaptive Stabilized Transient Analysis), a FEM-based DNS solver, we simulate electric field interactions in two-phase flow scenarios. By integrating experimental data with advanced simulations, we provide a comprehensive analysis of bubble behavior under constant and transient electric fields.</p>

        <p>This work includes a detailed parametric study and comparisons of our simulation results with existing simulation papers and experimental data. It sheds light on the fundamental processes and enhances the efficacy of plasma applications in environmental and agricultural systems.</p>
